# Improving-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm

A comparison between Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* algorithm, and Landmark algorithm.

Details:

The input file is stored in graph1000.txt
The input graph has 1000 vertices. Each vertex has an (x,y) coordinate where x is the latitude and y is the longitude of the vertex.
It also includes a list of adjacencies between the vertices of the graph.

The program outputs two things:

First part: 
  Randomly generate 20 query pairs of the form (q1,q2). For each query:
    Determine the shortest distance in G from vertex q1 to vertex q2 using Dijkstra’s, A* and Landmark  algorithms. 
    Output the number of vertices Dijkstra’s algorithm has visited.
    Output the number of vertices A* algorithm has visited.
    Output the number of vertices Landmark algorithm has visited.
Second part: Determine, on an average, what are the savings if A* and Landmark algorithms are used instead of Dijkstra’s algorithm
